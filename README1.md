Checkpoint 1:
In the Project of Convolutional Neural Network and it's applications, I have coverd Basic Machine Learning from the Course on Coursera By Andrew Ng. I started with the basic Python and solved basic assignment on Python and Github to make my base stronger.
Here is the content of this course I've completed till now:
Week 1: Univariate Linear Regression, Parameter Learning and Linear Algebra
Week 2: Multi variate Linear Regression
Week 3: Logistic Regression, Multiclass Classification, Regularization and Problem of Overfitting
Week 4: Neural Networks and it's Applications
Week 5: Cost Function and Backpropogation and Applications of Neural Networks

Along with this I've another 4 assignments. These assignments containing Machine Learning Problems of:
1. Basic Python and Github
2. Linear Regression
3. Logistic Regression
4. Neural Network

As I've completed all the basics required to learn Neural Network and most probably from the next time we will start working on projects in group.



Checkpoint 2:
During second phase of project completed with the remaining work in phase 1, like completed Assignment 4. And after that completed Andrew NG's basic course on Neural Network ans Deep Learning of 4 weeks, during which I covered following topics:

 1.Binary Classification using Logistic Regression
 
 2.Neural Netwoks Basics
 
 3.Shallow Neural Network
 
 4.Deep Neural Network

After that I chose a topic of Image Super Resolution for group project under mentor Sahasra Ranjan. In the first session of paper discussion sahasra gave brief introduction of paper and asked to implement Simple CNN using tutorial shared and go through some concepts like PCA, DCT and YCrCb and RGB and go through Bicubic interpolation.These are prerequisites for final project to be done in next phase.
